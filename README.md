Welcome to the Traffic Data Analysis Program! This Python application processes traffic data from CSV files, analyzes vehicle metrics, and visualizes the results using a Tkinter-based histogram. Itâ€™s designed to provide insights into traffic patterns at two junctions: Elm Avenue/Rabbit Road and Hanley Highway/Westway.

Overview
This program, developed by Mario Ockersz (Student ID: w2119866), processes traffic data stored in CSV files (e.g., traffic_dataDDMMYYYY.csv). It validates user input for dates, extracts metrics like vehicle counts and speeds, calculates statistics, and displays a histogram of vehicle frequency by hour. The results are saved to a text file (results.txt) for record-keeping.

Features

Input Validation: Ensures valid date input (DD MM YYYY) with checks for leap years and month-specific day limits.
Data Processing: Analyzes CSV data to compute metrics like total vehicles, electric vehicles, and speeding incidents.
Visualization: Displays a histogram comparing vehicle frequency at two junctions using Tkinter.
Persistence: Saves analysis results to results.txt.
Multi-File Support: Processes multiple CSV files in a loop until the user exits.

Prerequisites
To run this program, you need:

Python 3.6+: The program uses standard Python libraries.
Tkinter: Usually included with Python; ensure it's installed (sudo apt-get install python3-tk on Linux if needed).
CSV Files: Traffic data in the format traffic_dataDDMMYYYY.csv (e.g., traffic_data21062024.csv).

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/traffic-data-analysis.git
cd traffic-data-analysis


Ensure Python is Installed:Verify Python version:
python3 --version


Prepare CSV Files:Place your traffic data CSV files (e.g., traffic_data21062024.csv) in the same directory as w2119866.py. The CSV should have columns like JunctionName, Date, timeOfDay, VehicleType, etc.


Usage

Run the Program:
python3 w2119866.py


Enter Date:

Input the day (DD), month (MM), and year (YYYY) when prompted.
Example: For traffic_data21062024.csv, enter 21 06 2024.


View Results:

The program processes the CSV and displays metrics in the console.
A Tkinter window shows a histogram of vehicle frequency by hour.
Results are appended to results.txt.


Analyze Another File:

Choose Y to process another CSV or N to exit.

Program Structure
The program is organized into several components:

Input Validation (validate_date_input, validate_continue_input):Ensures valid user input for dates and continuation prompts.

CSV Processing (process_csv_data):Reads CSV files, computes metrics (e.g., total vehicles, speeding vehicles), and handles errors like missing files.

Display (display_outcomes):Prints analysis results to the console.

File Output (save_results_to_file):Appends results to results.txt.

Histogram (HistogramApp):Uses Tkinter to create a bar chart comparing vehicle counts by hour at both junctions.

Main Loop (MultiCSVProcessor):Orchestrates the workflow, allowing multiple file processing.


Key metrics include:

Total vehicles, trucks, electric vehicles, and two-wheeled vehicles.
Buses heading north from Elm Avenue/Rabbit Road.
Percentage of trucks and scooters.
Peak traffic hours and rain duration.

Sample Output
For traffic_data21062024.csv, the console output might look like:
___Starting traffic data analysis___

Please enter the day of the survey in the format DD: 21
Please enter the month of the survey in the format MM: 06
Please enter the year of the survey in the format YYYY: 2024
